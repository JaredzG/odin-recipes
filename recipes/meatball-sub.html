        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>3/4 cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 French baguette</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, gently mix by hand the ground beef, bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic, parsley, Parmesan cheese, and egg.<br>
                Shape into 12 meatballs, and place in a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cooked through. Meanwhile, cut the baguette in half lengthwise, and remove<br> 
                some of the bread from the inside to make a well for the meatballs. Brush with olive oil, and season with garlic powder and salt.<br> 
                Slip the baguette into the oven during the last 5 minutes of the meatball's time, or until lightly toasted.</li>
            <li>While the bread toasts, warm the spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat. When the meatballs are done, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the sauce.<br> 
                Spoon onto the baguette and top with slices of provolone cheese. Return to the oven for 2 to 3 minutes to melt the cheese. Cool slightly, cut into servings, and enjoy!</li>
