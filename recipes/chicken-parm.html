        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>By Chef John from 
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223042/chicken-parmesan/">AllRecipes.com,</a>
            this chicken parmesan is a little different than<br>what they
            do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.</p>
        <p>This is a quick and easy recipe, good for 4 servings, that is sure to satisfy your cravings for a
            savory, delicious meal!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>1 cup olive oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) 
                on a solid, level surface.<br>Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 
                thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly withsalt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
            <li>Dip flour coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to breadcrumb mixture, 
                pressing the crumbs into both sides. Repeat for<br>each breast. Set aside breaded chicken breasts 
                for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken 
                until golden, about 2 minutes on each side.<br>The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a baking dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of tomato sauce. Layer each 
                chicken breast with equal amounts of<br>mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle 
                1 to 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese on top and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, and chicken breasts are no longer 
                pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.<br>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
                read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
